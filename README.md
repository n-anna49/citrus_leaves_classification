# Citrus Leaves Image Classification
The following project uses TensorFlow's built-in citrus_leaves dataset to train a convolutional neural network model to classify images of leaves into one of four categories. Two models were built: one using the standard dataset, and the other applying image augmentation to the dataset images to determine any effects towards the model's performance.
